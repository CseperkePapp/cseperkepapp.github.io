## 🎯 What is This?

Welcome to my animation laboratory - a growing collection of interactive web experiments that push the boundaries of what's possible with modern CSS and JavaScript. Each project explores different aspects of motion design, user interaction, and creative coding.

## 🚀 Current Experiments

### 🌌 [Rising Info Snippets](https://github.com/yourusername/rising-info-snippets)
*Parallax floating cards with 5 depth layers*

**[🔗 Live Demo](https://yourusername.github.io/rising-info-snippets)** • **[📱 CodePen](https://codepen.io/yourusername/pen/xxxxx)**

- **Interactive floating animation** with smooth parallax depth
- **5 distinct layers** moving at different speeds for 3D illusion
- **Click to pause** - examine content while animation continues around it
- **Fully responsive** - optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Science content** - quantum physics concepts as floating knowledge

**Tech Stack:** Pure CSS animations, JavaScript event handling, responsive design
